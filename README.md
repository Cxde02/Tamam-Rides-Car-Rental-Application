# Tamam-Rides-Car-Rental-Application
## Interactive System Design Assignment - Android/IOS Application
Tamam Rides, the car rental application, originated as a collaborative effort within the confines of a university assignment. Developed by a team of three individuals, myself included, the application was conceived to provide users with a seamless platform for browsing and renting cars. Our collective effort brought forth a user-friendly interface that enables individuals to effortlessly explore a diverse range of available vehicles and conveniently secure rentals. Tamam Rides not only serves as a testament to our dedication to the project but also exemplifies our commitment to creating practical solutions within the academic realm.
